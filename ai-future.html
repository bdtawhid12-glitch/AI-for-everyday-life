      <h1 class="t">The Future of AI</h1>

<p>
  Artificial intelligence is evolving fast — not just in doing single, specialized tasks, 
  but in combining skills to handle more flexible, human-like work. As AI systems grow 
  more powerful, society has to navigate some big questions: how to keep algorithms fair, 
  how to protect people’s data, and how humans and AI can work together without losing 
  control or trust. The future isn’t just about smarter machines — it’s about building 
  tech that actually benefits people.
</p>

<h2>Things to Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Responsible AI and Regulation:</strong> Governments and companies will need 
    stronger rules to make sure AI is transparent, unbiased, and safe to deploy in areas 
    like healthcare, finance, and education.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Human + AI Collaboration Tools:</strong> Expect more tools where humans handle 
    creativity and judgment while AI handles speed, data, and automation — a partnership 
    that boosts productivity rather than replacing people.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>New Jobs and Reskilling:</strong> AI won’t just erase jobs — it will reshape 
    them. People will need new digital skills, and companies will have to invest in 
    training so workers can actually keep up with the tech.
  </li>
</ul>
